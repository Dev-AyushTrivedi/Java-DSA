## Sorting:
            - Arranging in an order.
    
        ## Basic Sorting Techniques or Algorithms:
                                                1. Bubble Sorting
                                                2. Selection Sorting
                                                3. Insertion Sorting
                                                4. Counting Sorting (Advanced)
                            
        ## Bubble Sorting :
                        - Large elements come to th end of an array by swapping with adjacent elements.

        ## Selection Sorting :
                        - Pick the smallest from unsorted and put it at the beginning.

        ## Insertion Sorting :
                        - Pick an element from unsortd part and place in the right positiion in sorted part.

        ## Counting Sorting :
                        - It will count the frequency of element occurance in array.
