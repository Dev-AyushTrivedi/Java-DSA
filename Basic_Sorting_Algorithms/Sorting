    ## Basic Sorting Techniques or Algorithms:
                                                1. Bubble Sorting
                                                2. Selection Sorting
                                                3. Insertion Sorting
                                                4. Counting Sorting (Advanced)
                            
    ## Bubble Sorting :
                        Large elements come to th end of an array by swapping with adjacent elements.
