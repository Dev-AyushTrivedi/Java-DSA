## Functions:
            It is a blog of code that can do a perticular task repeatedly, It is a reusable part of a program.

            Sysntax:
                    returnType name(){
                        //body
                        return statement
                    }
            
            Syntax: with parameter:
                                    returnType name(type parameter1, type parameter2){
                                        //body
                                        return statement
                                    }
    

## Call by Value:
                    - if you have pass a value in a function then anychange occur in value/variable then it will remain changed in the whole function but not in the main function. Because in java when you pass the value in function then the original value/variable is given to that function but a copy of that function is given to function.

## call by Reference:
                        - A function is a call by original value is called call by Reference it happens in C++.


## Method's:
            there are two types of Method in java:

            1. User defined
            2. inbuilt methods


## Function Overloading:
                        Multiple functions with the same name but different parameter.


## Scope :
            it is the limit of variable to be used in the program, i.e. If you declare a variable then scope is that where the variable is used in the entire code that is called scope of that variable.
    
## Method Scope: 
                if you declare a variable in the function then you can use that varible in that entire function.

## Block Scope: 
                When ever the variable comes under any block or { } then 
                their scope is present inside the block , it can be used inside that block only.
